# ball-ballance
openCV ball ballance table
This project is based on OpenCV libraries that communicate with real world using serial converter and Arduino nano.
Cpp file contain software code for windows application with, PID algorithm coeficient and HSV filder values.
Arduino code contain simple serial reader and convert text to values whitch uses to control servo motors for X and Y axis.
